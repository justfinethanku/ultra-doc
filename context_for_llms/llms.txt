# AI Assistant Navigation Guide

## Getting Started

Welcome! This directory contains LLM-optimized documentation for this project.

### Quick Start

1. **Read CLAUDE.md first** - This is the main entry point with project overview and navigation guide
2. **Use INDEX.md** - File inventory and quick reference
3. **Check JSON overlays** for efficient context fetching:
   - SECTIONS.json - Token-optimized content sections
   - CODE_POINTERS.json - Documentation to source code mappings
   - RELATIONSHIPS.json - Dependency and relationship graph

### Best Practices for AI Assistants

- **Start with CLAUDE.md** to understand project structure and documentation layout
- **Use SECTIONS.json** to fetch specific sections instead of entire files (saves tokens)
- **Check CODE_POINTERS.json** to find relevant source files for a documentation topic
- **Reference RELATIONSHIPS.json** to understand dependencies and relationships
- **Prefer INDEX.md** for quick file lookup

### Available Files

- test-sync.md

### JSON Overlays

- SECTIONS.json - Tokenized content sections with metadata
- CODE_POINTERS.json - Mappings from documentation to source code
- RELATIONSHIPS.json - Project dependencies and documentation relationships

## Navigation Tips

- Documentation is organized by topic, not by source code structure
- Each markdown file focuses on a specific aspect of the project
- JSON overlays provide structured, queryable metadata
- All documentation is kept up-to-date with automated scripts

## For Human Readers

This documentation is designed to be useful for both AI assistants and humans.
Start with CLAUDE.md for an overview, then explore the topic-specific documents.
