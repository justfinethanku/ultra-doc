# Ultra-Doc: AI Documentation System

Analyze your documentation and interactively choose what to do. This command will:

- Analyze current documentation state
- Detect code changes, errors, and gaps
- Present findings and ask what you'd like to do
- Execute chosen action (fix errors, update docs, write missing sections, etc.)
- Validate accuracy and keep docs synced with code

Use the `ultra-doc` skill to handle all documentation operations.
