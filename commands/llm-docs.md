# LLM Documentation System

Install or refresh the LLM-optimized documentation system for this repository. This command will:

- Detect if the system is already installed
- If not installed, ask a few setup questions and install everything
- If already installed, refresh all documentation and JSON overlays
- Generate SECTIONS.json, CODE_POINTERS.json, and RELATIONSHIPS.json for token-efficient AI context

Use the `llm-docs-builder` skill to handle the installation and maintenance process.
